Sou carioca, designer gráfica, e acima de tudo uma pessoa que tem curiosidade e amor pela vida. Isto significa que gosto de uma variedade de atividades e assuntos. Amo fotografar, brincar de chef, ler, esportes ao ar livre, descobrir musicas e ritmos novos, amo viajar e conhecer gente. De tanto viajar por aí acho que aprendi um pouquinho do que a gente gosta de encontrar quando está visitando uma cidade como o Rio, uma cidade que amo!

My husband, Andre, and I have an amazing 5 year old daughter who is our everything.  

I first came to Rio in 2003 for work in the Fashion industry.  It just so happened my now husband was my then agent.  He showed me the local style of Rio and I instantly feel in love.  Well, at first with the City and the country and later him. : )  

I currently have a business teaching english conversation to kids while doing all kinds of American crafts, games, theater, and cooking.  I am also starting a professional organizing service as well.  My husband(Andre) has his own company for 18 years Importing and Exporting here in Rio.  

Andre, is a huge water guy, he surfs stand-up, Kite and short board.  He is a triathlete.  Needless to say we spend most of our time outside, at the beach or around the beach life style.  I on the other hand, love Yoga, meditation, cooking, gardening, a good book, dance, good wine, fashion, interior design and most of all travel! 

We are fortunate to be a family that travels internationally many times each year.  My daughter is already bilingual and working on her third language, (mandrin).  We spend most of our time here in Rio but also travel to the US, mainly St. Louis Missouri(where my family lives) and in Los Angeles (where I lived for 20 years).  We also travel to Asia regularly and plan to live there for 3 months this year.  

In one of my many past careers I was a professional Dancer and had the good fortune of working for a famous band.  I traveled all over the world for 5 years.  It was a special time and an honer and a pleasure to have the experience of knowing so many incredible placed and people.  It would be very hard to pick one but I must say the Magical Island of Bali is my all time favorite.   I am already planning our family trip around the world when my daughter turns 10.  

We hope to see you here in Rio Soon

Il est notamment connu pour être le quartier artistique de Rio; en effet, il y a beaucoup de manifestations culturelles organisées par les locaux et on y trouve un grand nombre de petits ateliers. Comme le quartier est situé sur une colline, vous profiterez de vues imprenables sur toute la ville, que ce soit la partie Nord (Maracana, Sambodrome ...) ou la partie Sud (Pain de Sucre, la baie de Guanabara ... ). Etant à la lisière de la forêt de Tijuca, vous serez surpris par sa végétation. C'est un petit village en plein coeur de la métropole, tel une petite île.

Vous êtes les bienvenus à la Casa 48 pour changer d'avis sur les favelas et vous rendre compte que les médias et certains guides de tourisme en rajoutent un peu trop.

Lapa is home to samba musicians, capoeira players, and other marginals and bohemians and has been referred to as the ""South American Montmartre"". It still carries the soul of Rio in streets filled with music and the most interesting characters. Because of its location between the historical center of Rio, the bustling downtown, and the hills of Santa Teresa, it has always has a mix of people from all walks of life. Corporate office workers come here to drink during the week, while on the weekends it is taken over by all sorts of people looking for fun (from sambistas to rockers to playboys to funkeiros). And of course, there are the traditional families that live here and make up the bulk of the population on any normal day. Lapa is a small neighborhood so everything can be done on foot.

It's the only way to enter the building, meaning our apartment stays super safe.

Prazer, eu sou Fabiana. Tenho 34 anos, sou carioca, historiadora, professora e guia de turismo cultural. 
Sempre gostei de compartilhar o que sei sobre a história e cultura do Rio, descobrindo a diversidade que esta cidade maravilhosa pode oferecer.

Amo viajar, especialmente para áreas urbanas. Eu também gosto de música, folk latino americano, jazz, rock e ritmos brasileiros como samba, choro, bossa etc, Também curto espaços culturais e de arte e costumo ir a museus, exposições de arte, ou apenas sair por aí andando e procurando algum graffiti novo pela cidade.

Hey ! Welcome! I am Fabiana, a 34 year old historian / teacher / tour guide who loves to travel, learn and chat. I always loved to share what I know about Rio history and culture,  discovering the diversity that this wonderful city can provide. This love became my job, and   I enjoy exploring the streets, listen to its music, know interesting people and discover the best places to live Rio.  
I have been an Airbnb host since 2011, when I started renting my family´s place for tourists and started my own small tourism business, Alma Carioca Turismo, where I offer culture city-tours and some great Rio experiences. It has been a great opportunity to make cultural interchange and turn guests into new friends I love to travel, specially for urban areas. I also enjoy music, brazilian rhythms as samba, choro, latin american folk, jazz, etc. I love art and enjoy going to museums, art expositions, or just walking around seeing some new graffitis at the city. 
Rio is multiple cities in this same city, with its welcoming people, beautiful beaches and mountains, historic sites and its vivid and pulsate culture.  I hope I can help you to enjoy your stay here.

Armin, November 2016: "" Staying in Jane's apartment was like staying with a friend. From the moment of the first contact, her helpful instructions to the stay itself it was like going to someone's home I felt very familiar with. Jane even helped me find my phone when I left it in a taxi.""

Assia, June 2015: "" Jane is very friendly and attentive person. She helped us in organizing airport transfers and city tours. Also she organized my surfing and art day. Her list of recommended places to try was very well selected. Jane is the queen of the Superhosts! Thank you, Jane!""

Tara, September 2013: ""I don't even know where to begin!!! We booked Jane's place for our television crew as we were shooting a travel tv show in Rio for four days. We had a fairly large group and a ton of big boxes with all kinds of equipment. Leading up to the stay, Jane was incredible. Not only was she easy to get ahold of, she emailed all kinds of suggestions and tips on where to eat, where to go, where to find the most 'visual' spots...you name it. The location of her place can't be beat. In fact, the pool area on the roof overlooks the Fasano's pool! Since it was Rock in Rio, we were actually able to use a zoom lens and see John Mayer taking a dip (don't tell him!) her place is RIGHT ON THE WATER..and you get a view of Ipanema beach, plus a view of the Christ. The apartment is beautiful...spacious, roomy and the master bedroom is off the charts. It's secure and the guys who work the front desk are fantastic. The best part about Jane is how excited she is to share her city with others. She gets such joy knowing you'll be there having fun. My only regret was that she was not in town while we were there. I will absolutely stay there with my family when we go back! I want to make sure I meet Jane in person!""

Lee, April 2013: ""I've saved the best for last: Jane herself. Jane was a gracious host, very proactive communicator, who made sure everything was perfect, before we arrived through until after we left. She obviously takes a lot of pride in her million dollar property, and she was like family. It was my wife's 50th birthday, and when we arrived, Jane had arranged to have a home-made birthday cake waiting, and even sent my wife a bouquet of flowers. She could not have been a better host.

The person that I meet here is different from the ones that I discover while I'm travelling. I live with a friend alone and we share the space with some intelligent life (plants and some small visitors). I am, indeed, a constant seeker. What I am seeking? That's the true question. 

In this search I found news and healthy ways of eating. Food is one of my favorites adventures. 

I also discovered that to eat I needed to plant. And that led me to permaculture, bioconstruction and all the old new ways of trying to live in a more sustainable way. My last interest is the world of soapmaking, natural extracts and other goodies for the body.

I studied Social Science in college to try to understand the world, our society. Now, I'm trying to erase all that to finally understand myself. I'm still a student.

I try to compost, recycle, reuse water, save electric energy and meditate. That's the way I found to reduce our impact at the planet. Here I cook, make bread and pizza, do exercises, read books, play music, clean the house, do gardening, make soap and try to be awake in the meanwhile. It's the adventure of being alive.

Meu nome é Brux e sou Italiano.  Estudei no Instituto de Arte na Italia e na universidade da Ciência do Esporte. Apos me formar, decidi me mudar para a Califórnia, onde eu ganhei um Bacharel em Marketing e fiz um Mestrado em Relações Públicas.  Foi chefe do departamento criativo e de marketing da Giorgio Armani em Milão durante 7 anos, e fiz consultorias para outras empresas Italianas e Americanas do luxo. Em 2007 me mudei para o Rio de Janeiro para relaxar.  Agora faço consultoria para empresas de moda internacionais que querem entrar no Brasil, para empresas brasileiras na área de imagem e marketing, e para pessoas na área de design de interiores. Comecei em Airbnb em 2010 como guest em São Paulo, e foi nesse momento que decidi que queria ser um anfitrião também. Comprei um estúdio e coloquei no airbnb quando em Ipanema havia 9 anúncio e no Rio cerca de cem, agora há quase 50.000.  Adorei a experiência e tenho acompanhados a trajectória de airbnb com interesse e emoção. Realmente gosto de encontrar meus convidados e dar eles dicas e truques sobre o Rio.  Mas nao e' sempre que consigo ... ai minha ajudante Rita os encontra para mim, ou também deixo as chaves em um Master Lock para permitir o check-in autônomo.  Em 2017, fui convidado a ser Líder do Clube de Anfitriões do Rio de Janeiro, juntamente com outros 2 hosts. Organizamos encontros, ajudamos novos hosts a configurar as próprias listagens ou preparamos listas de ajudas sobre como o usuário pode aproveitar melhor a plataforma. Foi uma experiência muito gratificante que me colocou em contato com a equipe da airbnb no Brasil e me deu acesso a mais informações sobre a empresa e seus acontecimentos. Tem sido uma viagem incrível e uma experiência que mudou minha vida.  Estou definitivamente feliz de todas as notícias e novos produtos que airbnb está lançando.

My name is Brux and I was born in Italy.  I studied in the italian art highschool and Sport Science University.  I then moved to California where I gained a bachelor in Marketing and took a Master's in Public Relations.  I headed the creative services and marketing department of Giorgio Armani in Milan for 7 years, and I did consultancies for other italian and american companies.  I then moved to Rio de Janeiro in 2007 to relax.  Now I do consulting for international fashion companies who wants to enter into Brazil, for Brazilian companies in the area of image and marketing, and for privates in the area of interior design.  I started on Airbnb in 2010 as a guest in Sao Paolo and decided I wanted to be a host as well.  I bought a studio and put in on airbnb when in Ipanema there were 9 listing and in Rio around one hundred, now there are almost 50.000.  I really enjoyed the experience and accompanied the airbnb trajectory with interest and excitement.  I really like to meet my guest and gives them tips and tricks about Rio. But sometimes I am not able... so my help Rita cheers them for me, or I use a Master Lock for self check in. Em 2017, I was asked to be Leader of the Host Club of Rio de Janeiro together with other 2 hosts.  We organize encounters, help new hosts set up their listing, or prepare how-to-do lists for user of the platform.  It has been a very rewarding experience that put me in contact with the airbnb team in Brazil and gave me access to more information about the company and its growths.  It has been an amazing trip and experience that changed my life and I am definitely happy of all the news and new products that airbnb is launching.

Vidigal is Rio's most;none;Vidigal is Rio's most foreigner-friendly favela community. It is relatively small and picturesque, and offers some of the best views of Rio. If you are feeling adventurous I recommend a 2 hour-long walking trail to the top of the Dois Irmãos (Two Brothers) mountain. The view is stunning and well worth the effort. Vidigal is very popular with artists, young Brazilians and foreigners. The streets are winding, narrow and steep, dotted with small eateries, bars, and shops. You are sure to get a good workout whether going up or down!  During the day the streets are teaming with merchants, moto taxis and residents going about their business. One could spend hours watching the interesting life here from one of the many restaurants just a short stroll away. At night there are a selection of bars to sample. You are walking distance from the Vidigal beach at the Sheraton Hotel. It takes roughly 15 minutes to walk to it. Ipanema and Leblon beaches are a short distance away, again walkable (35 min;As this is a shared residential property, parties and extra guests are prohibited.   There are 5 friendly dogs living on the property. If you dislike dogs this is probably not the best choice for you.;From the Airport: You cannot call an Uber from the Airport so the next best option is a taxi.  Make sure you choose a certified taxi and get clarification on the fare. At times taxis are reluctant to go up the narrow Vidigal streets but my street is only the 2nd right off of the main winding road. During your stay in Vidigal if you get tired of walking up and down you can use the Moto Taxi which offer a fast and inexpensive service at a price of 5 reais per person (Jan 2016) or alternatively a van/kombi (official transportation vans).;;;Nenhum animal de estimação, por favor Não se aceitam visitantes ou festas O check-in às 13: 00h Check-out às 12h00;;;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/16106390/32543fca_original.jpg?aki_policy=large;;1194918;https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/1194918;Sonia Gallo;2011-09-22;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;"Originally from Sao Paulo, Vidigal has been my home for the last 30 years.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

That's also where we first lived when we got married 4 years ago. That's when we renovated the place. We spent a wonderful time there and we definitely have many cherrishble memories about it. 

In 2011 we spent 2 weeks in Paris in a rented apartment. We loved the experience because it was cozy, it was charming, it made us feel like we were one of the locals and it was also cheaper than a hotel. Then, later that same year we moved to another place, and based on our wonderful experience in Paris, we decided to rent our apartment.

We hope you can feel as good and have a memorable time in it, just like we did.

Estou no Airbnb desde 2011 e sou um grande fã da Plataforma. Tudo que conquistei foi graças ao sucesso no Airbnb!

Minha experiência começou quando recebi um flat da minha avó através de herança (em vida!!), investi pesado na reforma do apartamento para poder oferecer o maior conforto possível aos meus hóspedes. Comecei a administrar seu aluguel e o sucesso foi tão grande que mudou a minha vida!

Meus amigos e familiares viram como o meu “negócio” estava dando certo e começaram a pedir para que eu também administrasse o aluguel dos apartamentos deles (nessa época ainda não existia a figura do co-host). 

Topei o desafio e o número de apartamentos foi se multiplicando! O resultado foi ótimo e percebi que me sentia muito realizado com as experiências que estava ganhando como empreendedor e ao conhecer pessoas de tantos lugares do mundo! De tal maneira que decidi largar meu emprego como gestor em marketing para me dedicar exclusivamente a vocês!

Fiz um curso de guia de turismo para ter mais conhecimento sobre a cidade e abri a All in Rio, uma Agência de Turismo que oferece tours culturais, naturais e de aventura, além do aluguel de apartamentos de temporada.

Meu objetivo é oferecer uma estadia segura, confortável e poder fornecer todas as informações necessárias para você desfrutar ao máximo a sua experiência em nossa cidade maravilhosa! 

Obrigado pela atenção!

Hi!

I've been on Airbnb since 2011 and I’m a big fan of the Platform. All I got was thanks to my success on Airbnb!

My experience began when I received a flat from my grandmother through inheritance (in life!!). I invested heavily in the renovation of the apartment to be able to offer the greatest comfort possible to my guests. I started managing the rent and the success was so amazing that it changed my life!

My friends and family noticed how well my ""business"" was going and started to ask me to manage their apartment’s rent too (at the time, the figure of  the co-host didn’t exist).

I accepted the challenge and the number of apartments was multiplying! The result was great and I realized that I felt very fulfilled with the experiences I was gaining as an entrepreneur and by meeting people from so many places in the world! So I decided to leave my job as a marketing manager to dedicate myself exclusively to you!

I took a tour guide course to gain more knowledge about the city and opened the All in Rio, a Tourism Agency that offers cultural, natural and adventure tours, as well as apartments for seasonal rents.

My goal is to offer you a safe and comfortable stay and to be able to provide all the information necessary so you can enjoy your experience in our wonderful city to the fullest!

Thank you for your time!

Fabio

We have tried to move out a couple of times, but we just can't. Nowhere else in Rio you'll find this sweet neighborhood feeling, in which you enter bars and cafes and feel you're entering a friend's place. The little plaza just outside our door is where families and friends gather at night, grab a beer and a pizza, and enjoy our lovely weather. We're also strategically located, right atop the city's historic and financial and cutural center (Lapa).;;There's a bus line that passes right in front of our house and takes you downtown (it's a 20 minute ride). There's also a volkswagen van regular line (until 11pm) that takes you to the subway, in the Gloria neighborhood. You can also walk down the stairways to Bairro de Fatima (10 minute walk) and catch a bus to literally any neighborhood in Rio.  Sometimes cab drivers will refuse a ride up to Santa Teresa. They say it's because of the tram tracks (it's supposed to damage their tires) but the truth is that it takes a little while to climb the hill, and the ride is too cheap (R$10 to R$15 from downtown or Lapa), so they don't find it worth it. But after a couple of attempts, there's always a cab to come up at night.

Hey ! Welcome! I am Fabiana, a 34 year old historian / teacher / tour guide who loves to travel, learn and chat.

This love became my job, and   I enjoy exploring the streets, listen to its music, know interesting people and discover the best places to live Rio.  
I have been an Airbnb host since 2011, when I started renting my family´s place for tourists and started my own small tourism business, Alma Carioca Turismo, where I offer culture city-tours and some great Rio experiences. It has been a great opportunity to make cultural interchange and turn guests into new friends I love to travel, specially for urban areas. I also enjoy music, brazilian rhythms as samba, choro, latin american folk, jazz, etc. I love art and enjoy going to museums, art expositions, or just walking around seeing some new graffitis at the city.

I'm pretty much an organized person who likes the house to be fresh and clean so I appreciate people not to wear shoes inside the house. Overall I'm a relaxed and easygoing person as you will find out by yourself.
Hope to see you in Rio!

I grew up in Copacabana.  From the 70´s I saw big transitions in my town.  In 2005, I decided to make a big change in my life and left a partnership on a Mexican food business to go on tourism. It was not easy to leave everything  behind and at the age of 42 go to a new career.

Today I am absolutely sure I did the best working decision of my life. I love my life and enjoy to meet new people every day. At the same time that I am giving information, I get to learn a lot from my clients.

I have been receiving over 200 people every year and also renting 70% of the apartments I manage. I am sure that at the end of your vacation you will not only miss Rio, but will have made a new friend.

When I was younger I used to spent a lot of time on  the beach. Even during stormy days I was able to swim and relax in a place that, to me, is the most peaceful place on earth: the Atlantic ocean. Nowadays, I still go body surfing, but not like I did before.

Hoping to meet you,

It is expected that you treat the apartment and all its amenities just like yours.  Air condition and lights should be turned off when you are not in the apartment. Damage caused by the behavior of a Tenant, or a Tenant’s guest, will be repaired at the Tenant’s expense. We can make arrangements to receive the guest(s) at the airport (check availability) or at the apartment, on check-in, to hand over the keys.  It is the Tenant’s responsibility to return keys at check-out. Os vizinhos precisam ser respeitados, então sem barulhos muito altos após as 22hrs.

I grew up in Copacabana.  From the 70´s I saw big transitions in my town.  In 2005, I decided to make a big change in my life and left a partnership on a Mexican food business to go on tourism. It was not easy to leave everything  behind and at the age of 42 go to a new career.

Today I am absolutely sure I did the best working decision of my life. I love my life and enjoy to meet new people every day. At the same time that I am giving information, I get to learn a lot from my clients.

I have been receiving over 200 people every year and also renting 70% of the apartments I manage. I am sure that at the end of your vacation you will not only miss Rio, but will have made a new friend.

When I was younger I used to spent a lot of time on  the beach. Even during stormy days I was able to swim and relax in a place that, to me, is the most peaceful place on earth: the Atlantic ocean. Nowadays, I still go body surfing, but not like I did before.

Hoping to meet you,

Rogerio

Santa Teresa, the Montmartre of Rio de Janeiro, is the city’s most well-preserved and artistic district with many mansions dating back to the late 19th and early 20th century.

We have spectacular sunrises and sunsets from our window, but it is so easy to walk a few minutes to watch the sunset over Ipanema.  Everything in  Ipanema and Copacabana is accessible just by walking. Ipanema is so charming, and Copacabana is 24-7, with lots of nightlife, and so many beach activities. I am here 3 months out of the year, and I rarely need to get into a taxi or metro.  One of my favorite things to do is hike to the top of Fort Leme which is at the end of Copacabana.  This is a protected and very safe area, and you can walk up to the top for a phenomenal view of Rio, Copacabana, and Sugarloaf -- and you are most likely to have it nearly all to yourself!  It's so easy to walk or run miles in both directions, as well as swim, and surf.  Our apt looks down on a paddleboarding school, as well as another for Beach Volleyball. It's so easy t;If you didn't even leave my apartment, amazingly you could have a good trip to Rio, and still see a LOT!!  But, of course you will be out and about. Staying here will ensure you really do get the most out of your stay in Rio, both night and day.  I work from my computer here for 3 months of the year, and it is wonderful to look up and see the beach, and Sugarloaf, and hear the waves all day.  I can even see Copacabana Beach in the mirror as I shave!  You will definitely not only experience Rio to the fullest, you will feel a part of our magical city! Our electrical outlets supply the same current as the U.S. and accommodate plugs for both Brazilian, and all American appliances.  We buy virtually all our electrical equipment and appliances in the U.S. and bring them to Rio.;It's less than 5 minutes walk to the Metro Station General Osorio, and the Metro will take you to the downtown business district, ferry and bus terminals, and to just about everywhere you will want to go.  Buses that will also take you nearly everywhere are also at the back entrance of our building at Ave. Copacabana.  Of course, taxis are easy to catch and ubiquitous in my neighborhood. But most importantly it is so easy to walk to so many of the things you will want to see, so you will need to spend by far less time getting to places -- you are already there!;The beach is just out the door, and you will find our apartment is so convenient to everything you will need.  Within one block you will find banks, ATMs, supermarkets, juice bars, a delightful European bakeries, Oceanside dining, many bars, pharmacies, newsstands, clothing shops, and a two gyms. The General Osorio Metro station is just 4 minutes walk away, and buses stop behind our building. It is terrifically convenient!

Today I can proudly say that my family and I have welcomed people from all over the world and most importantly we have been receiving strong reviews consistently, not only about the apartment itself, but also about the personal service we love to provide to our guests. Hosting is something I really enjoy doing. The attention I give to my guests, I do with passion. I believe the secret to be a successful host is to love what you do. In fact, I put a lot of my time to make sure my apartment is a welcoming place for everyone who wants to stay there, making their stay an unforgettable time in Rio. 
Personally, I like to travel the world, as a result, I have an understanding of what is important to someone when it comes to explore another city. For example, going to the right places at the right time, getting some deals and exploring places where only local would know about it, making their trip extra special.
I enjoy taking the time to think about little details. e.g. providing a city map, preparing the apartment with fruits and treats, as well as being available to all my guests all the time not only to answer questions but also to give last minute suggestions.
 I am available to help my future guests in customizing their vacation based on their needs and interest.
Be one of my guests, send me a message. I am looking forward to welcoming you in Rio too.

I'm an original Carioca, born and raised in Leblon, right now living in Gávea.

I love getting in touch with different cultures and share experiences and ideas. I like to travel a lot, bike, run, work-out, watch UFC, relax at the beach and a good cold beer in Baixo Gávea.

I'm a very informal person and host, a huge fan of Rio and i invite you to come to this amazing city and stay in one of my places.

I try to offer the best support for those who come to my proprieties. The same support that i would like to receive when I’m travelling. 
I´m a fan of Rio de Janeiro and hope you enjoy as much as i do! 

Once in Rio, if you have some time you should go to Búzios, Ilha Grande and Visconde de Mauá (Maromba and Maringá), places that I like so much!

Some comments from my guests: 

- Diogo is really friendly and helpful host, I can without a doubt recommend his service to my friends and anyone. Our experience in Rio was smooth and enjoyable thanks to him! (Timur from Ukraine)
- Diogo was an awesome host in an incredible city! He was very kind and the apartment was very clean, and all of the conveniences one would want while staying away from home: bedding, linens, TV & DVDs, wifi, laundy, etc. Diogo took time to check us into the property, give us a list of things to do and see and eat, had a map for us, and took care of EVERYTHING! If you are looking for a nice, clean, safe place to stay in Rio, then this is the spot! (Justin Lee from Canada)
- Diogo was a fantastic host and was ready to help at any point in time. We were able to communicate through (Hidden by Airbnb) and provided advice and answered questions I had about Rio. The apartment was what we expected and advertised. Fantastic location and not too big. It was clean and had towels, sheets, etc. What was a big surprise was the fact that Diogo had stocked the place with some snacks, beer, soda, etc. It was a really great surprise and something I was not expecting. The wireless internet, TV, radio, etc. all had clear instructions which was fantastic. I would recommend this place to any of my friends and family (Chris Whittam from USA)
- Diogo is an amazing host. He made sure the apartment was clean and everything was well explained. He helped with suggestions for places to eat and go out, and he was very flexible letting us stay late when our flight was delayed. The apartment is in a prime location in the middle of iconic Ipanema - only 1 block from the beach. It very comfortably fit 8 and had a nice common area that accommodated us all as well ( Robbie from USA).";within a few hours;97%;;f;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/eeaa0cd1-4436-44c6-b986-13a955e76d81.jpg?aki_policy=profile_small;https://a0.muscache.com/im/pictures/eeaa0cd1-4436-44c6-b986-13a955e76d81.jpg?aki_policy=profile_x_medium;Leblon;50.0;50.0;['email', 'phone', 'facebook', 'reviews', 'jumio', 'government_id'];t;t;Rio de Janeiro, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;Leblon;Leblon;;Rio de Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro;22430-170;Rio De Janeiro;Rio de Janeiro, Brazil;BR;Brazil;-22.98176138103282;-43.22190013686867;t;Apartment;Entire home/apt;10;2.5;3.0;5.0;Real Bed;"{TV,""Cable TV"",Internet,Wifi,""Air conditioning"",Kitchen,""Free parking on premises"",""Smoking allowed"",""Pets allowed"",Doorman,Elevator,""Buzzer/wireless intercom"",""Family/kid friendly"",Washer,Essentials,Shampoo,Hangers,""Hair dryer"",Iron,""Laptop friendly workspace"",""Pack ’n Play/travel crib"",""Hot water"",""Host greets you""}";0.0;$201.00;;;$900.00;$160.00;2;$50.00;2;365;today;t;28;52;82;175;2018-04-14;83;2012-04-25;2018-03-23;93.0;10.0;9.0;10.0;10.0;10.0;9.0;f;;;t;f;strict;f;f;47;1.14;2018;4;;;;;;;;;;

In the main street there are bus stops to South and North zones where you can get to Christ the statue e.g. in 20 minutes. To Sugar Loaf you can take subway + connection bus and get there in 30min or walk 10minutes and get a bus that goes straight there in 20minutes. There's Flamengo beach in walking distance but it's not v good to swim. Also Gloria marina where once in a while there are parties and some festivals and on Sundays all highways in that area (Aterro do Flamengo) are closed for recreation and leisure. You can take a VW bus to go to Santa Teresa, a district with a lot of good restaurants and museums (and graffiti for those who like it) and some of the most beautiful;"PLEASE HAVE IN MIND THAT If you bring a visitor without my consent, you'll be asked to leave the apartment immediately without any refund. So, by booking my place for your stay, you agree with this ""rule"". Important: Check in and check out can be flexible! However I'll let you know if I have guests leaving on the day you arrive and/or arriving on the day you leave.  If yes, check in is at 1pm. But if there's nobody staying in my extra room the previous night, no problem with getting here earlier than that. Check out is at 11am. If I have someone coming on the day you're leaving, you must leave the room at that time. Unfortunately, You cannot leave the bags at the apartment to pick up later as I won't have keys available for you to come back and I will probably won't be at the apartment during the day.";;Other stuffs: The use of the washing machine is NOT allowed. There is a laundromat one block away from the apartment. You can use everything in the kitchen (fridge, oven, stove, microwave and utensils) -  not my food, obviously. You'll find two small couches and a dining table in the living room. You have TV in your room with cable TV. Sometimes there's a TV in the living room, sometimes not. If you have a wifi device (laptop, iphone) there's wifi in the apartment. Linen and towel are included. Unfortunately I don't offer breakfast but there are juice shops in the main street or you can buy food/drinks in the market, stock it and prepare in the morning.;About me and friends: My place has 3 rooms: one that I rent, one that I live  and another one that my friend lives (when he's in Rio) or that I rent on Airbnb too.** So you may share the apartment with me and one other person!   My apt is gay friendly and we are smokers (we smoke in the living room sometimes).  Sometimes friends come over (eat, drink, etc before going out) and sometimes they sleep over too. They're usually talkative, easygoing, Xfactor fans..  but want you to know it before booking my/your room! So this is kinda important to some people: if youre looking for company to do stuffs or someone to chat about your day, this is not the best place for you! Sorry!  I go to uni really early in the morning and after that I go to work until the evening so you won't see me much and if you do, I'm probably passing out tired.

I have been living in Brazil for about four years and before that was a regular visitor to these shores for a number of years. I used to have an apartment in Salvador da Bahia which I often rented out as a furnished holiday apartment to visitors from all over the world, so I think I have a good idea of what it takes to create a comfortable and welcoming home-from-home and the importance of taking care of the small details which make the difference between an average holiday apartment rental and a really good one.
I have travelled extensively and lived in the UK, the US and South Africa before finally coming to rest in the ´´cidade maravilhosa´´ with its breathtaking scenery, wonderful climate and a warm and friendly people. These days, I make my living as an English teacher in Rio and have no plans to move on  - unless the travel bug bites again!

=========================================================Sou o Vinicius ,  atualmente mora na Ilha da Gigoia, lugar paradisíaco na Barra da Tijuca,  no Rio de Janeiro / Rj / Brasil e sou anfitrião da Airbnb desde 2012 alugando casa e  quartos nas Ilhas Primeira e Gigoia, no belíssimo complexo lagunar da Barra da Tijuca. Tenho também opções em toda a Zona Sul do Rio de Janeiro e também na Zona Norte. Eu não moro nas casas que alugo , portanto você ficara com toda a casa a sua disposição.
